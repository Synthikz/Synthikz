# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Synthikz!

I'm a young tech enthusiast who loves programming and exploring new technologies. I have experience with languages like **JavaScript**, **Python**, **C++**, and **C#**. I'm not a master yet, but I'm learning and improving every day! ðŸ’ª

I love helping others, but sometimes I worry about not being able to provide the best assistance. So, I prefer to be cautious and keep learning until I'm more confident. ðŸ¤”

Iâ€™m a native Spanish speaker ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ and I know a bit of English, somewhere around B1/B2 level, but Iâ€™m always working to improve! ðŸŒ±

One of my greatest passions is creating my own programs and games ðŸŽ®. Iâ€™m aiming to graduate in **Computer Science** and build even cooler projects along the way! ðŸš€

## Technologies I work with ðŸ’»:
- JavaScript
- Python
- C++
- C#

Feel free to explore my repositories, ask questions, or just connect! Let's grow together in the world of technology! âœ¨
